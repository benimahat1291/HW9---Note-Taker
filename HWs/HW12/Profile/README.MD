This is project for University of Denver, the second assignment where we were tasked
to build a webpage that acts as our biograpy. The main tasks was to use HTML and CSS 
to incorperate bootstrap into our webpage. This is a powerfull tool that lets us style
out webpages so that they both look nice and are responsive in design to acomodate the 
different screen sizes we view webpages in the modern world. 


For this project I Have created 3 html files that house the code for my webpage:

index.html ----> This acts like the homepage where you can find info about me.
portfolio.html ---> This will be where I will be where I can showcase my various projects.
contact.html ----> This is the page with the contact sheet.
main.css ----> here is where I do the main styling that is not taken care of by bootstrap. 
img ----> which is a folder that contains theclear pics my websites will be using

***** Essentially This is one webpage but to make the webpage more ineractive the NAV bar will
      Guide the user to a individual section that goes in more detail with the section********
